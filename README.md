_Parse raw oven data and output details in a more useful format_

Welcome to OvenReader!

OvenReader is a program built to automate the process of parsing a specific
type of text file. This text file (or "report") contains a unique collection of
data points which are generated by industrial oven software -> i.e. cook data.
OvenRreader parses these reports, creates a Cook object which encapsulates
the unique data relevant to that specific cook, and finally outputs a formatted
visual of the critical data points for easy viewing.

**\*\*Disclaimer\*\*** \
This project was built for parsing very specific data which is organized in
uniquely formatted text files. This format may not be universal, and the
program may need to be tuned accordingly for anyone using this code in their
own projects.

For the sake of privacy and compliance, all names and product information used
in the example data **_.\docs\404E_PL123456L.txt_** (report titles, program
names, employee names, product names, and lot numbers) are fictitious.
***

## Requirements
1. _**Python [3.8+]**_: Can be downloaded ->[here](https://www.python.org/)<-

_Some older versions of python may work, but this has not been tested._
***

## Instructions
This program was built for the CLI. Simply download the package, and
run `py .\src\ovenreader.py` (from the package directory) to start the
program. The example file can be used for testing purposes, as follows:

(The **.\\** can be omitted if you're working from the package directory.) \
`py .\src\ovenreader.py` \
(At the prompt...) \
`.\docs\404E_PL123456L.txt`


**\*\*NOTE\*\*** \
_Users may need to run `python .\src\ovenreader.py` depending on their setup._
